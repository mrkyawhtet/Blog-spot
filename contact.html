            Most of the students spend too much time on sports and they spend less time studying. Most of the parents want their children to spend more time studying. I will show you what is more important.

            Playing sport can be good for your health and your body will fit. Not only good things but also it has some risks. Playing sport too much is can be damage your muscles. If you paly sport most of the times, you will be weak in other things such as school lessons and jobs.</p>

           <p> Playing sports can be affect with 2 ways for studying. Good and bad way. Playing sport is good for brain because if we play sport our circulatory system will healthy. So, it will affect to brain. It is one of the good way. But, if you are the person who play sport too much, it will be weak in school lessons like I said.

            In my opinion, students should spend more time studying instead of spending too much time on sports because in our age, learning is really important for the rest of our life. You can play anytime after school.

            So, I agree with students should spend more time studying instead of spending too much time on sports. If you are really good at sport and spend too much time on sport, you should do athlete.</p>

    Money is more important than a job. I don't think so. Most people want a lot of money without hard working. My essay will show you how job satisfaction is more important than money.

        In most of the family, they cost a lot of money for food, monthly cost of electricity and water. We have to pay for that. And if you want to stay in a big house with great car, you will cost more than other people. So you will need a great job to get a lot of money and to stay with your family happily.</p>
    
      <p>I know money is important for life but if you are not happy in your work, you can't do the best. So you will not able to get a lot of money and your life will not improve. A good job can change your life. A good job means, if you love and happy with your job, the job will improve and it will be a great job one day exactly.
    
        So what I think is a good job is giving you money and it is really important. You also need to happy with your job too. Even if you have a good place in company like CEO, you need to happy with your job to do the best.
    
    So, if you have a plan to stay in a big house with a great car, you need to have a good and happy job. That is why I don't agree with money is more important than job satisfaction
